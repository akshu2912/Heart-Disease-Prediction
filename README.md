# Heart-Disease-Prediction
##Overview

This project aims to predict heart disease using multiple supervised learning algorithms. It leverages various machine learning techniques to classify whether a person has heart disease based on multiple health parameters. The dataset used contains medical attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.
##Results

The performance of each model is compared based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics. The best-performing model is selected based on these results.

##Conclusion

This project provides an in-depth comparison of various supervised learning algorithms for heart disease prediction. The findings can help in identifying the most effective model for predicting heart disease based on medical data.
